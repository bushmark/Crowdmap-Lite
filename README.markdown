Crowdmap Lite
=============
Crowdmap Lite is an open source webapp built to show off some of the basic functionality of the Crowdmap API. It can be used standalone as a website or as a starting point for your own projects.

System Requirements
-------------------
To install the platform on your computer/server, the target system must meet the following requirements:

* PHP version 5.3.0
* An HTTP Server like Apache or nginx.

A database is not necessary since this application interfaces with Crowdmap via the Crowdmap API.

Required Extensions
-------------------
The follwing is a list of PHP extensions that must be installed on your server in order for Ushahidi to run properly:

* mcrypt (http://php.net/mcrypt) is required for encryption.
* cURL (http://php.net/curl) which is used to access remote sites.

__NOTE: Need to figure out what extensions you already have installed on your server? Here are instructions to do just that: http://jontangerine.com/silo/php/phpinfo/__

This application comes packaged with a Pagoda Box Boxfile that will allow you to deploy this app pain free on the Pagoda Box service.
